## Overview
Serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I became fascinated with the idea of creating and growing a vision. Our vision is really what we envision ourselves doing and becoming in the future. Essential to that creation is drafting and managing a vision board. In progressing towards accomplishing vision items, goals should be set that help one to make progress along the way. My Goals was made in an effort to reduce the headache in making a paper vision board out of images or magazine cut outs.
